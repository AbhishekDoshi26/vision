# vision
This repository contains code files for the app named Vision.<br>
This app has some special features which can be used by <b>Blind People</b>!!<br>
<br>
Assume that there is a paper on which something is written. <br>
Now, if the blind person wants to read it, they can't.<br>
 <br>
 To open the app, they just need to speak"<b>OK Google! Open Vision.</b>"<br><br>
So, they can simply click the pic.<br>
 <br>
The app recognizes text from the paper (OCR) and then converts it into audio (TTS) which can be heard by the user!!
 <br><br>
  <h3>So, great!! Now they have VISION!!<h3>
